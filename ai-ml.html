                <p class="step-description">Manual task allocation is tedious and prone to errors as well as time-consuming. Our AI-powered system takes the complexity out of task assignments by considering team members name and project category or their job role. Within 4 to 5 characters typed, it will predict the tasks easily, and from their you can directly select and assign them. This means your team can focus on executing tasks rather than spending time figuring out who should do what. The AI guarantees prompt and efficient task assignment, enabling you to start working immediately.</p>
